        <h1>End Effector</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">As a part of my work on the Cornell Mars Rover project team, I designed and built an end effector to be mounted onto the rover's arm. This arm is used to pick up rocks of complicated geometry, carry up to 5 kg, and complete several dexterous tasks such as typing on a keyboard, screwing in a screw, moving around a joystick, and flipping switches.</p>

        <h2>01. First Prototype</h2>
        <p>The first prototype utilized a four-linkage system and a DC motor. The end effector also had a camera and self-actuating screwdriver. Unfortunately, the prototype had too much total weight and the 3D prints could not sustain carrying the maximum load of 5kg. This failure led to a complete redesign of the gripping mechanics.</p>

        <h2>02. Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>The final prototype utilized a linear actuator and springs to create a gripping mechanism that could bend in more, allowing the end effector to improve its grip of rocks. Additionally, the end effector employed <strong>TPU grippers</strong> to better adjust to the rugged edges of rocks. The end effector had both a camera and a laser to make it easier for the controls team to use.</p>
