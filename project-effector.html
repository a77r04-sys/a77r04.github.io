        <h1>Rover End Effector</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            As part of the Cornell Mars Rover team, I designed and built an end effector mounted onto the rover's arm. This system is critical for picking up rocks of complicated geometry, carrying up to 5 kg, and completing dexterous tasks such as typing, screwing, and flipping switches.

        <h2>01. First Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            The first prototype of the end effector utilized a four-linkage system and a DC motor. The design incorporated a camera and a self-actuating screwdriver mechanism to assist with equipment servicing tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> Unfortunately, the prototype had too much total weight, and the 3D printed components could not sustain the stress of carrying the maximum required load of 5kg. This failure led to a complete redesign of the gripping mechanics.

        <h2>02. Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            The final prototype utilized a linear actuator and springs to create a gripping mechanism that could "bend in" more, allowing the end effector to improve its grip on irregular rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the end effector employed <strong>TPU (flexible) grippers</strong> to better adjust to the rugged edges of rocks. The end effector had both a camera and a laser to make it easier for the controls team to align the arm. To save weight, the self-actuating screwdriver was removed in favor of the improved gripping capability.
