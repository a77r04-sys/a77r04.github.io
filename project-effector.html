        <h1>End Effector</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            As a part of my work on the Cornell Mars Rover project team, I designed and built an end effector to be mounted onto the rover's arm. This arm is used to pick up rocks of complicated geometry, carry up to 5 kg, and complete several dexterous tasks such as typing on a keyboard, screwing in a screw, moving around a joystick, and flipping switches.

        <h2>01. First Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            The first prototype of the end effector utilized a four-linkage system and a DC motor. The end effector also had a camera and self-actuating screwdriver. Unfortunately, the prototype had too much total weight and the 3D prints could not sustain carrying the maximum load of 5kg.

        <h2>02. Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>
            The final prototype of the end effector utilized a linear actuator and springs to create a gripping mechanism that could bend in more, allowing the end effector to improve its grip of rocks. Additionally, the end effector employed TPU grippers to better adjust to the rugged edges of rocks. The end effector had both a camera and a laser to make it easier for the controls team to use. This end effector no longer had the self-actuating screwdriver.
