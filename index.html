            <p>Hi! My name is Ari Rabinovitz, and I am a senior at Cornell University studying Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I am the lead of the arm sub-team of the Cornell Mars Rover project team, working to build a rover to compete in the University Rover Competition (URC). This past summer, I was employed as a Deployable Technologies Intern at Physical Sciences Inc., designing a gripper that enables rescue litters to be carried for long distances, testing a pump designed to handle low-lubricity fluids, and assisting in the development of a lightweight mobile folding bridge. I have also performed research for the Cornell ASTRA (Advanced Space Technology Research and Architecture) Lab, working on novel propellants for electrospray technologies. Since my sophomore year, I have been working as a research assistant at Cornell Space Structures Lab, assisting in the design of a boom deployment mechanism for ultra lightweight booms.</p>
            <p>I have taken numerous engineering courses, including <i>Dynamics, Introduction to Fluids, Mechanics of Materials, Mechatronics,</i> and <i>Heat Transfer</i>. This school year, I am excited to take classes related to space, including <i>Intermediate Dynamics</i> and <i>Spacecraft Technology and Systems Architecture</i>.</p>
